# 1cbyc Custom Library Management System

## Looking at what I've built in the past with C++, i think i should experiment this with python too. It's due.

I will explain my process to development here too.

Let me setup the project structure so i don't forget because i am lazy too, sometimes.

- I added models
- I added controllers next
- i added the expected views
- i then added the services needed (liek search)
- for others, i added the requirements i think i might need

- okay, i fixed the most important, let me make tests then actually start coding. i just want the instant gratification
- i forgot to ad __init__.py in all directories
